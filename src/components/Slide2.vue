		<h2 class="sub-title">Composition API</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>
				The Composition API is a significant feature in VueJS 3 that
				revolutionizes how developers structure and organize their code.
			</p>
			<p>
				It promotes a more modular and organized codebase, allowing
				developers to encapsulate logic within well-defined composition
				functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				This results in better code maintainability and reusability, making
				it easier to manage and scale Vue applications.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="sub-title">Options API</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>
				The Options API in VueJS 3 is a familiar approach for developers who
				have experience with earlier versions of Vue.
			</p>
			<p>
				It offers a more declarative way to define component logic and
				provides a clear separation of concerns.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the Options API, developers can define data, computed
				properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks in a straightforward
				manner.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="sub-title">Faster Rendering</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>
				VueJS 3 places a strong emphasis on improving performance, and one
				of the standout features is faster rendering.
			</p>
			<p>
				VueJS 3 is optimized for speed, with a fine-tuned reactivity system
				that significantly reduces rendering overhead.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reactivity tracking mechanism is smarter, leading to faster
				updates and a smoother user experience.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="sub-title">Improved TypeScript Support</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>
				VueJS 3 has made substantial strides in enhancing its TypeScript
				support, making it more robust and developer-friendly.
			</p>
			<p>
				TypeScript users will appreciate the improved type inference and
				error checking, which leads to more reliable code and better tooling
				support.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vue components can be more strongly typed, catching errors at
				compile-time rather than runtime.
